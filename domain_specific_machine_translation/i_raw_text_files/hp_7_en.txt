THE DARK LORD ASCENDING

The two men appeared out of nowhere, a few yards
apart in the narrow, moonlit lane. For a second they
stood quite still, wands directed at each other’s
chests; then, recognizing each other, they stowed
their wands beneath their cloaks and started walking
briskly in the same direction.

“News?” asked the taller of the two.

“The best,” replied Severus Snape.

The lane was bordered on the left by wild, low-

diamond-paned downstairs windows. Somewhere in
the dark garden beyond the hedge a fountain was
playing. Gravel crackled beneath their feet as Snape
